# Lektor-Icon Theme

*Copyright Â© 2016-2018 Lektor-Icon Contributors and others (see AUTHORS.txt)*

This a version of the [FreeHTML5](https://freehtml5.co/) ["Icon" theme](https://freehtml5.co/](https://freehtml5.co/icon-free-website-template-using-bootstrap/) for Lektor by [Daniel Althviz](https://dalthviz.github.io/) and the [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) organization, originally based on the [Hugo port](https://github.com/SteveLane/hugo-icon) by Steve Lane.
The core template is a single-page, responsive layout, with sections for describing your organization and its mission, services, a gallery, your team and how visitors can download your software or donate to your cause.
Also features additions including a built-in blog, generic page template, custom error page, common navbar, Gitter, Disqus and OpenCollective integration, heavy customizability, numerous fixes and improvements, and re-written for speed, extensibility, responsiveness and standards conformance.


## Installation

See the [Lektor theme docs](https://www.getlektor.com/docs/themes/).
We recommend installing Lektor-Icon as a Git submodule, as we often update and improve it from time to time.
